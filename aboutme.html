<h2>Biochemical Engineering</h2>

  <h1>Future Career</h1>
  <p>I have just started my freshmen year of high school and I am still a bit iffy about what career to pick. But at the moment I would like to be a biochemical engineer. I would expect to make a salary from $97,000-$161,000. I would most likely expect to live in either California or Massachusetts. In order to get that job I would have to go to college and get a phd in biochemical engineering in order to make the most out of my career.I would try to get into colleges such as Duke which specializes in this research.  </p>

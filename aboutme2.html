  <h1>A Brief Biography About Me</h1>
  <p>My name is Darian David Rezania I am a 9th grader and go to Canyon Crest Academy. I love science,sports, and history and try to make almost anything I do in my life include one of the three. My favorite hobbies are to read history and science books, read non fiction books, and to watch football. As much as I love reading I love following sports even more. My favorite teams are the New England Patriots, Boston Celtics, and New England Revolution. I have always loved sports and it has influenced me to become the person I am today. 
 I was born in Princeton, New Jersey and lived in that area for the first thirteen years of my life. I have lived there for almost my whole life making it hard for me to transition from New Jersey to San Diego after I moved.</p>

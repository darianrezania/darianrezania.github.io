<h1>Movie Review</h1>
<p>The Avengers Age of Ultron<p>

<p>The movie The Avengers Age of Ultron had a good plot but had the same exact plot as the first movie. The bad guy has a giant army and it seems impossible for the avengers to save the day. Somehow it happens anyway. The plot was good but made the movie a bit too predictable. The CGI was very good and was just astonshing. The acting was very good and all the action scenes were amazing as well. Overall the movie was good but was just a bit to predictable for the viewer.</p> 
<p>I personally thought that the Age of Ultron was a very good movie that was very interesting and exciting with twists and an interesting ending. Overal I think the movie was a great success and amazing.

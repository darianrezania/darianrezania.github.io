<h1>The New England Patriots</h1>
<p>The New England Patriots are not only my favorite football team but also my favorite sports team. The Patriots have been a part of my life ever since I was 4 and received my first jersey. Also half of my family lives in Boston and my constant trips there made me love the team even more. My uncle and friends and Massuchusetts influenced to like the team by making me watch the Patriots play. The  team has just inspired and shown me that you should never give up even if the odds are 1000 to 1.  </p>
